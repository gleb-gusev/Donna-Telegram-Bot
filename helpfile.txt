Well, here is the list of things we can do together ;)

/start

Use this command first, and let's get to know each other.

/flashback 

Use this command, and live through the scene with me and Josh from the Shadow of the Two Gunmen 2x02. Except - you will be on the Josh place. 

Personalized Donna experience! 

Pretty cool, right?

/quote

I'm trying to remember my best lines, but my memory is pretty limited now. Let's not do this at the moment.

/search

You remember that I'm the best secretary, right? When we will get to know each other better I will help you to find anything you want.

So, that's it for know. Don't hesitate to write me ;)
